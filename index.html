    <p>Chess is a game about strategy and thinking.</p>
    <li>This game needs you to think</li>
    <li>The game is very addicting and fun</li>
    <p>When I play chess it makes me relax and it makes me get into the moment.</p>
    <p>THE CHESS EMPIRE. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED this is where it came from</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is to get the opponet's king in a position where the king cant move without being attacked.</p>
    <p>There are no real rules, as long as you know how to move you are free to do whatever.</p>

    <p>There are 16 Pieces on one side and 16 on the other. The pieces are called King, Queen, Biship, Knight,Rook and the pawn.</p>
    <p>I found this from aliexpress</p>
    <h1>The knight</h1>
         <p>This piece can move in an L shape and the L has to be four spots. When this peiece moves, it can only take a piece when it is about to land. This piece is the only piece that can jump over pieces. This is one of the best pieces on the bord.</p> 
    <p>This came from"chess game Strategies"</p>
    
    
	  <h1>The queen </h1>

    <p>This is one of the most powerful pieces because it can move like every piece on the bord except the Kinght. This is good for all types of traps. For example, if your opponent's king is in a tight space you can possibly get a checkmate. </p>

     <h1>The Pawn</h1>
    <p>This piece is a very slow piece. It cant move backwards and it can only move up and can take diagonal but only one space. When your get this to the end of the bord, you can get any piece you got took. This piece is over looked and it need some credit for how great it is.</p>

    <h1>Bishop</h1>

         alt="bishop"
         height="180">
    <p>This can move in a diagonal on any part of the bord. This piece is good for long attacks and short attacks. This piece takes more thought because its hard to use and it can ger in the way somtimes. But as long as your use it properly, this can be the strongest piece on the bord.</p><p>Written by the MasterClass staff Last updated: Sep 29, 2021 â€¢ 4 min read</p>

    <h1>Rook and king</h1>

         alt="king and Rook">
    <p>This can go up and down and left and right. Also this can swap places with the king and the only way it can do that is when there are no pieces in the way. The king can only move in one space in any direction. The Rook can move up and down left and right in any direction. Both pieces
      are good but the king is not suppose to fight because once your king is surrounded and nothing to protect it, you will loose.</p>
